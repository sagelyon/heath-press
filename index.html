    <h2>Why Heath?</h2>

    <p>Digital printing is the game changer. We offer impeccable work on demand and on budget. Plus four cool bonuses:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Quicker Turnaround</li>
        <p>No plates to create and no “make ready” time. Your job can be on press in minutes instead of hours or days with traditional printing.</p>

        <li>Sharper Images</li>
        <p>Many designers prefer digital over offset printing. Colors are brighter and crisper because digital ink doesn’t diffuse into the paper fibers.</p>

        <li>Cost-Effective Small Runs</li>
        <p>We’re the king of low quantity perfection. And we do it without the costly mechanical set-up needed with conventional offset.</p>

        <li>Variable Data</li>
        <p>A digital press “writes” an electronic image for every image. That means each copy can be personalized with unique text or images.</p>
      </ol>

      <img class="img-responsive" src="images/image7.png">

      <p>Churches, charities, schools. We’re proud to help dozens of groups doing great work on tight budgets. We keep costs down and results up with weekly programs, capital campaigns, and curriculums. Our full-service letter shop handles your self-mailers, appeal letters, statements and more. Keep your marketing materials and literature racks as fresh and timeless as your message.</p>
